# Software Engineering Repository

Welcome to my personal repository where I document and share everything I study in the field of software engineering. This repository is a reflection of my journey as a student and aspiring professional in computer science, mathematics, and beyond.

## About Me
My name is Zuher Khalaf. I am currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science in Salzburg, with plans to pursue masterâ€™s degrees in both fields. I am particularly interested in combining these disciplines with my passion for physics, chemistry, and philosophy.

## Purpose of This Repository
I created this repository to:
- Organize and track my learning progress in software engineering.
- Share my implementations of design patterns, algorithms, and other concepts.
- Build a portfolio showcasing my skills and interests for future academic and professional endeavors.

## Repository Contents
This repository will include:
- **Design Patterns**: Implementations of key software design patterns.
- **Algorithms**: Examples of algorithms from various domains.
- **Mathematical Applications**: Code bridging mathematics and computer science.
- **Exploratory Projects**: Projects that combine my interests in physics, chemistry, and philosophy with programming.
