# Singleton Design Pattern Implementation

This repository demonstrates the **Singleton Pattern**, a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## About the Project
- **Goal**: Showcase how to implement and use the Singleton Pattern in a thread-safe and efficient way.
- **Implementation**: Includes examples of lazy initialization, eager initialization, and thread-safe singleton implementations.

## Repository Contents
- **Core Code**: Java implementation of the Singleton Pattern.
- **Examples**: Use cases demonstrating global access to a single instance.
- **Documentation**: Explanation of different approaches and their trade-offs.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/singleton-pattern.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the provided Java files to explore various Singleton Pattern implementations.

## Purpose
- Understand how to restrict instantiation of a class to a single object.
- Explore different implementation techniques (eager, lazy, and thread-safe).
- Learn how to manage global state efficiently and safely.
