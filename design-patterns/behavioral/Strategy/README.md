# Strategy Design Pattern Implementation

This repository demonstrates the **Strategy Pattern**, a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime by defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable.

## About the Project
- **Goal**: Showcase how to implement the Strategy Pattern to decouple algorithms from the context in which they are used.
- **Implementation**: Includes strategies, a context class, and examples of dynamically swapping behaviors.

## Repository Contents
- **Core Code**: Java implementation of the Strategy Pattern.
- **Examples**: Use cases demonstrating interchangeable behaviors.
- **Documentation**: Explanation of pattern structure and its advantages.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/strategy-pattern.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the provided Java files to explore how behaviors can be swapped at runtime.

## Purpose
- Understand how to encapsulate algorithms into independent classes.
- Explore how to make systems more flexible and maintainable by separating behavior from implementation.
- Learn how to choose or switch between different strategies dynamically.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
