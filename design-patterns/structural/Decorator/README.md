Decorator Pattern: Dynamic Object Extensions
This repository demonstrates the Decorator Pattern, a structural design pattern used to dynamically extend the functionality of objects at runtime without modifying their structure or class definitions. The project includes an implementation in Java and showcases how decorators can be layered to provide additional behavior.

🚀 Introduction
The Decorator Pattern is part of the Gang of Four design patterns and is used when you want to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects in the same class.

This repository implements a classic example of the Decorator Pattern, including:

A core component interface.
A concrete implementation of the component.
Abstract and concrete decorators that extend the functionality of the base component.
💡 Why Use the Decorator Pattern?
Flexibility: Adds functionality at runtime without modifying existing code.
Reusability: Decouples base classes from additional responsibilities.
Avoids Subclass Explosion: Instead of creating multiple subclasses for different behaviors, decorators can be combined dynamically.
When to Use:
When object functionality needs to be extended dynamically.
When multiple features are needed but inheritance would lead to a rigid and complex hierarchy.
⚙️ How It Works
The pattern works by wrapping objects in decorators that provide additional behavior:

A Component Interface defines the basic contract.
A Concrete Component implements the interface and provides core functionality.
Decorators implement the same interface and wrap a component to add or override behavior.
🛠 Implementation Details
Key Classes:
Component: The core interface for all objects.
ConcreteComponent: A basic implementation of the component.
Decorator: An abstract class that wraps a component and delegates its operations.
ConcreteDecoratorA & ConcreteDecoratorB: Implement specific extensions of the component functionality.

🧠 Key Takeaways
The Decorator Pattern promotes open/closed principle, enabling you to add new functionality without modifying existing code.
Wrapping objects dynamically allows for high flexibility and avoids class explosion from inheritance.
Ideal for scenarios where features need to be selectively combined.
