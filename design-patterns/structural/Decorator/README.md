# Decorator Pattern Repository

This repository demonstrates the **Decorator Pattern**, a design pattern used to dynamically extend object functionality at runtime without altering their class structure. Itâ€™s a flexible alternative to inheritance for adding behaviors.

## About the Project
- **Goal**: Showcase how objects can be dynamically extended using decorators.
- **Implementation**: Includes a core component, decorators, and examples of combining functionality.

## Repository Contents
- **Core Code**: Implementations of the pattern in Java.
- **Examples**: Real-world inspired use cases.
- **Documentation**: Simplified explanations and usage guides.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decorator-pattern.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the provided Java files to explore the pattern in action.

## Purpose
- Learn how the Decorator Pattern works.
- Practice flexible and reusable design principles.
- Explore dynamic object extensions without modifying core code.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
