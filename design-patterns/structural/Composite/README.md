# Composite Pattern Repository

This repository demonstrates the **Composite Pattern**, a structural design pattern used to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly. It allows for hierarchical tree structures where operations can be performed on both single objects and groups.

## About the Project
- **Goal**: Showcase how to build hierarchical structures using the Composite Pattern.
- **Implementation**: Includes components, composites, and leaf objects with examples of their interaction.

## Repository Contents
- **Core Code**: Java implementation of the Composite Pattern.
- **Examples**: Real-world inspired use cases for hierarchical structures.
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations and usage guides.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/composite-pattern.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the provided Java files to see the pattern in action.

## Purpose
- Understand how to manage hierarchical data structures.
- Explore how individual and composite objects can be treated uniformly.
- Learn to simplify code when working with tree-like structures.
